# Measure Master Minigame

## Feature Summary
The Measure Master minigame teaches users how to Scoop and Simulate ingredient measurements without using traditional tools like measuring cups or spoons. The game introduces real-world interaction, where users attempt to estimate and pour various amounts of ingredients (such as water, flour, sugar, rice, etc.) based on recipes. They’ll check their estimations against real measurements to see how close they got, encouraging users to refine their ability to "Scoop and Simulate" quantities.

## Explanation

### 1.1 Feature Name
Measure Master Minigame

### 1.2 Challenge It Is Related To
- **Simple name:** Estimation Mastery
- **Whimsical name:** The Guess & Pour Challenge

### 1.3 Feature Summary
The Measure Master Minigame is a hands-on kitchen experiment where users practice estimating quantities of different ingredients without the use of measuring cups or spoons. After estimating, they measure the actual amounts to see how close they were. The game is designed to entertain and educate users, improving their confidence in the kitchen when it comes to measuring by eye. Real-time feedback and scoring track their accuracy, encouraging them to improve with each attempt.

### Purpose
- To improve the user’s intuitive understanding of portion sizes and measurements through a playful real-world activity.
- Help users develop a key kitchen skill—estimating measurements—while making the experience enjoyable.

### Objectives
- Increase user engagement during recipe prep.
- Teach users how to estimate measurements by eye.
- Encourage experimentation and mindfulness when measuring ingredients.
- Offer users immediate feedback on their progress.

### Player Behaviors/Outcomes
- Users actively engage by attempting to estimate quantities of ingredients like water, flour, or rice.
- They compare their estimations with real measurements using kitchen tools and track accuracy.
- The game promotes mindful measurement and builds confidence in gauging ingredient amounts.

## Gameplay Design

### 2.1 Core Mechanics
**Description:**  
The player is presented with a recipe step where they need to measure an ingredient (e.g., 1 cup of water or 100g of sugar). Without using measuring tools, they pour what they think is the correct amount into a container. After their estimation, they measure it for real and record how close they were to the target. The game tracks results across several attempts to show improvement.

**Controls:**
- Players pour ingredients in real life based on estimations.
- In the app, they input their estimated amounts and the actual measured result to get a score.
- An "End Game" button to complete the challenge when the user is done.

**Objective:**
- Estimate how much of an ingredient to add to a dish, then compare with the actual measurement.
- Track and record the difference between estimation and real measurement.
- Improve accuracy with each attempt.

### 2.2 Game Flow

**Start Menu/Onboarding:**
- An introduction screen with a playful message like “Can you trust your eyeball?” to set the tone.
- Simple instructions on how to estimate, pour, and measure ingredients.

**In-Game Experience:**
1. The user selects an ingredient they want to estimate (e.g., water, flour, rice).
2. They are shown the recipe’s required measurement (e.g., 1 cup).
3. The user pours what they think is the right amount, then measures it for real.
4. The app records how close they were to the target and displays the difference.
5. The game encourages multiple rounds to show improvement over time.

**Game Over/Rewards:**
- Once the user finishes the minigame, a scoreboard displays:
  - Number of estimation attempts.
  - Accuracy rate (e.g., how close they were on average to the target amount).
  - Fun facts or tips to improve their eyeballing skills.
  - Option to restart or challenge themselves with a different ingredient.

### 2.3 Game Modes
**Single-player Mode:**
- The user plays alone, working to improve their estimation accuracy through multiple rounds.

**Multiplayer Mode (Future Expansion):**
- Users can challenge friends or family members to see who can estimate ingredient amounts most accurately.

### 2.4 Challenges/Obstacles
**Challenges:**
- The main challenge is guessing the correct amount of ingredients without using traditional measuring tools. Factors like the size of the container, ingredient density, and personal bias all play a role in how close the player gets.
- The game escalates by introducing more complex measurements or ingredient types, like oil or finely powdered substances, where estimation is harder.

**Escalation:**
- Over time, the user may increase the complexity by working with trickier ingredients (e.g., measuring sticky ingredients like honey by eye) or by introducing time limits to estimate and pour.
